### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Seth Galluzzi

I graduated from Penn State University with a Bachelors in Mathematics Education in 2014. I spent 7 years in the math classroom helping students gain an understanding of high level math concepts and cultivating a belief in themselves to help them reach their goals. During my time as an educator I was a professional learning community lead, a teacher mentor, a basketball coach, and I created an after school tutoring program.  I also collaborated with other teachers to create an SAT prep course that helped students become more comfortable with the testing process and increased students' test scores.

Recently, I graduated from the University of Virginia with a Masters of Data Science. I learned valuable skills including python, SQL, docker, and snowflake. I hope to use my new skillset to implement change and to gain employment in an industry that challenges my problem solving skills, incorporates my team-oriented beliefs, and values my enthusiastic attitude.

Outside of work, I am an avid disc golfer and outdoorsman. I have hiked and explored over 25 different National Parks across the United States and I hope to eventually visit all 63! I love to meet new people and learn about different cultures through communication and cuisine.  

If you would like to collaborate please feel free to reach me at mrgalluzzi15@gmail.com, or connect with me on linkedin at https://www.linkedin.com/in/seth-galluzzi-538436240/.

I look forward to working with you!
